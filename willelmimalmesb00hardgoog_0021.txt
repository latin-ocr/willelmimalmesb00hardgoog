from the 11111110 01 this country. He designed
it, he said, 00 0 compendium 01 many historias,
although, from the larger portion relating to
England, he entitled it the ‘History os 1110Ι
Kings 01 Englandss

It rs to be regretted that 00 many pagos 0111111111

in his work, however, could be adduced which
seem strongly to favour the conclusion that Mal-

through the buildings 011110 cathedral, he writes
thus: ‘These and similar superstitious, such as
