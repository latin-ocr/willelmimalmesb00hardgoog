He appears in early life to have shown an ear-
nest love of study; and in the preface to his
second book, where he gives a brief account of
. his youth, he observes—‘ For a long time past,
thanks to my parents’ care and my own dili-
gence, Ι have been habituated to reading; a pur-
suit which had cbarms for me from my very
childhood, and with my years I have found its
attractione increase. In fact, my father brought
me up to think that is Ι directed my attention
to other pursuits, it would be a waste of life,
and a hazard of reputation. Accordingly, I pre·
vailed on myself, young as IwaS, to acquire a

to myself, show a distaste.' He then proceeds
to state that be was orally instructed in logio,
that he had devoted himself somewhat more
closely to physic, and that he studied ethics in
detail, which led him naturally to the cultivation
of history. His labours in this last study he
thus describes :····‘ Accordingly, aster Ι had accu-
mulated, at my own expense, various histories
of foreign natione, I proceeded, as my leisure
permitted, to inquire whether any records of
my own natlon worth transmitting to posterity
could be found3 for, not being content with the
writings of antiquity, I myself became possessed
