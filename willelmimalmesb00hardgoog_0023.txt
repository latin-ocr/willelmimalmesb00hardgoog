Paneion. xvii

deedS, 1 shall openly proclaim them, -his had
conduct 1 shall touch upon sparingly, though not
to conceal it3 so that neither shall my nar-

That Malmeshury was a man os tried inte· m· aa
grity and singular veracity, is manifest from his ‘'n''
works. When he has a doubt on the subject
ol which he is writing, though it were currently
believed in his day, his language is particularly
cautious, and he throws all the responsibility lor
the facts he mentions on the authors from whom
he derived them.

His style, especially in his earlier works, is nn ιω..
occasionallylahonred3 yet it abounds with choice
and elegant phrases. Much of his work is writ-

guage is usually concise, strong, and nervous,
it is nevertheless sometimes verbose and obscure.
Itis impossible to read his works without disco-
vering, from his frequent quotations, and suc·
cessful adaptation of their phrases, that he had
studied the Roman writers, and that his mind
was imbued with their spirit and beauty. He
has several times declared that he purposely
varies his diction,¹ lest the reader should be
disgusted hy its sameness 3 and he seems to have
been always anxious to avoid repetition.

There appears, however, to be one radical pponam·
