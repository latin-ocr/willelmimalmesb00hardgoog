basis of their history the copy of the chronicles
which they had consulted, followed it, having no
sufficient means of testing the correctness of the .
dates. Each monastery in the respective king-
doms of the heptarchy undoubtedly had an officer
who at the termination of every year recorded
the memorable occurrences, not only in the king-
domin which his monastery was situated, but
also those events of which he had heard in the
neighbouring kingdoms3 it is therefore but na-
tural to expect that discrepancies in dates will
be found, especially when it can be established
that the northern commenced the year at a dif-
ferent time from the southern writers. More·
over, in the manuscripts of the Saxon Chronicle
tho dates are expressed in Roman characters3
and it might easily occur in setting down 111. or
1111, and other numerals, that an I. might be
inserted or omitted, which error would of course
allect the subsequent series. These facts were
either not known or little regarded in Malmes· ,
bury's time 3 and as he must have observed many
obvious discrepancies‚ and was unable satisfac·
torily to reconcile thern, he may have adopted a
plan which seldom required him to affix the ox-
act date of a transaction. Not ambitious to be
a mere chronographer, it was enough for his pur·
pose to state thatin a given reign an occurrence
took place which produced certain effects3 bnt
whether it happened in the year 800, or 802, was
a matter of no immediate moment, the plan of
his work not requiring minute accuracy: but
this want of exactitude has occasionally, when
he has given the year, betrayed him into ana·
Α chronism3 and, in one or two instances, he has
actually made the event precede the cause. To

remedy this defect in some degree, and supply
