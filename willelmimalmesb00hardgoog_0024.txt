History,-a fault of design rather than of inad-
vertence. Fearful lest his work should assume the
character of a chronicle, he fell into the opposite
extreme, and frequently relates circumstances
without stating the exact year in which they

year was commenced on the aoth of March; but
at Worcester, and the monasterias founded by

monarchs different from those assigned in the
Saxon Chronicles. These writers, taking as the
