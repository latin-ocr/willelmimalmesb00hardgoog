man, who attempted to render these chronicles
into Latin3 his object I could applaud, if his
style did not disgust. Nor have 1 forgotten
Eadmer’s work, written iu temperate gracesul
language, in which he takes a cursory glauce at

and thence, taking a wider field, brings his co*
pious and useful history down to the death of
Archbishoprnselm.¹ So that, from the time of
Beda, there is a period of two hundred and
twentyfthree years of which there is no history:
thus the regular series of time halts in the
middle, from want of a connected relation.
Wherefore, as well out of love of my country as
out of respect to those who have enjoined me to
the undertaking, I have been induced to fill up
the chasm, seasoning my crude materials with
Roman salt, and, that my design may proceed
with greater regularity, I shall cull somewhat
from Beda, to whom I must often refer, glaucing
at some few things but omitting more.'

First-Authors and data still extant3 such
as Gildas, Nenuius, Beda, the Saxon Chronicle,
Saxon Laws, Asser, Aethelweard, Eadmer, Os·
berne, Gosceline‚ Hariulf, and other earlier
writerS, original charters, letterS, and official
documents.²
