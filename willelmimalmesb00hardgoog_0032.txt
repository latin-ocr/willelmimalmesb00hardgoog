rected. When · dates have been introduced in
the margin which did not occur in the text, a
note stating the authority has generally been
glvIetniuay possibly be thought that the present

edition is overhurthened with notes ; hut it must
he rememhered that the peculiar plan oi Malmes·
bury's History in m'any cases renders some com-
mentor annotation to the text necessary3 and
little has been done that will not either elucidate
the author's meaning, or save the reader the
trouble of referring to works not always at hand.

In every instance it is believed that the authority ’ 3

for the statement given is derived either from
contemporaneous sources, or from the hest ac-
cessible authority.

naon. ,The Editor cannot close these prefatory re-

marks without returning his thanks to those
friends who have assisted him during the pro-
gress of this work through the press; hut more
particularly to Sir Hamis NicolaS, G.G.M.G.,
and to John Holmoe, Esq. os the British Mu·
soum. To Sir Thomas Phillipps, Bart. not only
arethe Editor’s thanks especially dne, but those
also of the English Historical Society', he having
kindly lent several valuahle MSS. of Malmes·
bury to the Editor, for the purpose of collation.
From Mr. Samuel Bentley it would be unjust to
withhold a public acknowledgement of the very
great advantage this work has derived from the
skill and assiduity of his establishment: those
only who have been engaged in passing a similar
work through the press can adequately appre-
ciate the services sor which an editor may he
indehted to the vigilance and sagacity of the
printer.
