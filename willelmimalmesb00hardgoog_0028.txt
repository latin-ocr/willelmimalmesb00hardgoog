considerably greater number of errors than are
to be found in the London edition, though the
Frankfort edition professes to embody in the
text the corrections made in the table of errata

'natureae The text of thc present edition has been taken

from a MS. written towards the close of the
twelfth century, which formerly belonged to the
abbey of Murgan, founded by Robert earl of
Gloucester, the nobleman to whom Malmes·
bury dedicated his work. This magnificent MS.
now preserved among the Royal manuscripts in
the British Museum, (Bibl. Reg. 13. D. 11.) was
selected, after a careful examination and com·
parison with other manuscripts, because it was
found not only to be the least corrupted, but
to contain prcofs of the author’s latest correc-
tions. The only other MS. which agrees with
the Royal Manuscript, though not so ancient by
some centurias, is in the collection of Sir Thomas
PhillippS, Bart. From the various readings,
and from many important alterations observable
throughout, it is certain that the author made
several corrections in his work after he had com-
pleted it; and it is believed that traces may be
found of at least four distinct classes of copies of
the ‘Gesta Regum Anglorum,' and of two of the
‘Historia Novella' No one can examine the
various readings in the scot-notes of this edition
without coming to the conclusion that the author
was constantly employed in the correction and
amplification of his work. Many of his alter-
ations, it is true, are merely verbal; but they
contributa greatly to the eleganee of his dic-
tion. In some places severe expressions are mo·
dified and sostencd, whole passages are added,
