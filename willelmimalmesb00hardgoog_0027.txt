Pontificum! In dedicating his work to Quaen
Elisabeth, Sir Henry Savile passed this just eu-
logy on Malmesbury: ‘Inter quos cum et nar-
rationis fide, et judicii maturitate, principem lo-
cum teneat Guilielmus Malmesburiensis, homo,
ut erant illa tempora, literate doctus, qni septin-
gentorum plus minus annorum res tanta fide et
diligentia pertexuit ut e nostris prope solus his-
torici munus explesse videatur.'¹

The manuscript from which Savile's edition
was printed was either carelessly transcribed, or
the volume was incorrectly printed: the text
abounds with gross errors, which the table os
errata printed at the end of the work very inade-
quately remedies. From occasionel notices in
the margin, it is evident that Savile consulted
more than one manuscript: but instead of having
followed any one in particular, he seems to have
formed his text from several. The present
Editor has not met with any manuscript which
entirely agrees with Savile’s text: the Royal
MS. in the British Museum, 13. Β. xlx. comes
nearest to it, but does not thoroughly agree
with it. Savile has no authority for dividing
his work into chapters3 but his sections are
nearly the same as those found in the best ma
nuscripts. The edition commonly called the mort
